GREG all-in bot.
GREG can generate images, answer your questions.

TODO:
- add bot-connection to discord channel and ability to speak (suggest to write ffmpeg based lib for that)
- add ability to play music from youtube/spotify/soundcloud
- clean up the code

you can host it on termux. (but I prefer UserLand)
project is still under development.
